# Exploratory Data Analysis of Summer Olympics using Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly

Introduction
Every four years, thousands of athletes across the globe compete at the world's pre-eminent sporting event - the Olympics. The games are organized under the aegis of International Olympic Committee(IOC) in different host cities. Since its revival in 1896, the scope of the games and participation has increased in each edition.

Because the world's best sportspersons as well as nations compete, the Olympics is a also good starting point for sports enthusiasts interested in crunching and analyzing numbers. For a lay person, it becomes to difficult to analyze the plain data. Therefore, I will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process to explore the different dimensions of the Olympics, asking questions, demystifying myths and unveiling trends. But first let us understand what is EDA.

EDA is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop an understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns. We'll be using Python and its libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib to perform EDA.
